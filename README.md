# How Does the Magic Work?
Imagine you have a magic number (a credit card number). To see if it's a valid magic number, you need to follow these steps:

# Step 1: Write Down the Number

First, write down the magic number. Let's say our number is 1234567812345670.

# Step 2: Reverse the Number
Next, flip the number around. If your number was 1234567812345670, now it becomes 0765432187654321.

# Step 3: Multiply Every Second Digit by 2
Starting from the first digit (now the last digit of the original number), multiply every second digit by 2. Here's what you get:

Original: 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Multiplied: 0 14 6 10 4 6 2 2 8 14 6 10 4 6 2 2
# Step 4: Subtract 9 from Any Number Bigger Than 9
Now, if any of the numbers you got from multiplying are bigger than 9, subtract 9 from them. Here's what you get:

Original: 0 14 6 10 4 6 2 2 8 14 6 10 4 6 2 2
Fixed: 0 5 6 1 4 6 2 2 8 5 6 1 4 6 2 2
# Step 5: Add All the Numbers Together
Next, add all these numbers together to get a final total.

Adding them up: 0 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 60
# Step 6: Check if the Total is a Multiple of 10
The final step is to check if the total number you got is a multiple of 10 (like 10, 20, 30, etc.). If it is, then the magic number is valid! If it isn't, then the magic number is not valid.

In our example, the total is 60, which is a multiple of 10. So, the magic number 1234567812345670 is valid!

# Why Does This Magic Work?
This trick works because of the way numbers are arranged and multiplied. It's a clever way to catch simple mistakes in typing or copying down credit card numbers. It's like a safety net for numbers!
